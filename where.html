                        This navigation is a demonstration of tabindex. Tabindex is used to determine the order in which the tab key hits elements on the page. In this case, I wanted the main navigation menu to get selected before the image icon, so the <a> tags in the menu are set to have a lower tabindex than the clickable image.

                        Tabindex can also be used to make non-selectable elements selectable, though this is not usually recommended because we want to use semantic interactive elements where possible.

                                      This section demonstrates the use of the "hidden" tag. This is a warning, semantically marked as an <aside> tag. I used a small snippet of Javascript to hide this element when the Dismiss button is clicked by enabling the hidden attribute, demonstrating how "hidden" is used as a boolean that shows/hides elements on the page.

                                    <b>Note: Orion is not visible year round!</b> <br />
                                    Orion is only visible in the night sky from November to February. These are the months in which Orion is in the sky in the nighttime. The rest of the year, Orion is washed out by the sun in the daytime sky.

                            <p>
                                Because of Orion's location relative to other prominent landmarks and its own bright and prominent stars, the constellation is easy to find. These tips should guide you in the right direction to find Orion in the sky.

                                        <b>Look along the ecliptic.</b> <br />
                                        One easy technique to locate Orion is to follow the ecliptic. Orion is situated near the ecliptic, so we can look along the ecliptic to find it. The ecliptic is the path the Sun, Moon, and planets trace along the sky as they follow their orbits. This is the path the Sun follows from sunrise to sunset.
                                </li>

                                        <b>Look for Sirius.</b> <br />
                                        Another landmark to watch for is Sirius. Sirius is the brightest star in the northern hemisphere, so it is easy to spot. Sirius is also along the ecliptic, and Orion is right next to it. Trace a path from sirius eastward along the ecliptic, and Orion will be right there.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                        <b>Look for Orion's Belt.</b> <br />
                                        Orion's Belt is also hard to miss. Look for the distinct row of three bright stars and you've found Orion. Flanking Orion's belt, you should see Betelgeuse and Rigel.
